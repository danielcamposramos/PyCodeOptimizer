## Overview
"""
CodeOptimizer provides a sophisticated system for maintaining dual-version code bases:
1. HR (Human Readable) - Fully documented, verbose version
2. MR (Machine Run) - Optimized for memory and runtime performance

Key improvements over the original EchoSystems RunMaster idea:
- Enhanced comment stripping (handles multi-line comments)
- Advanced space optimization while preserving functionality
- Runtime code optimization pipeline
- Memory usage tracking
- Code validation
